## ℹ️ PROJECT SUBTITLE

![Screenshot of the project](./screenshot.png)

A simple space-themed animation that simulates the moon orbiting the earth using only HTML and CSS.

It was built entirely with HTML and CSS as part of the [**freeCodeCamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) CSS course.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project focuses on positioning and animation using CSS.  
The layout simulates a basic orbital system with Earth in the center and the Moon orbiting around it in a smooth circular path.

It uses `@keyframes` and `transform` to create continuous motion and demonstrates how relative positioning and parent-child transformations can achieve visually dynamic effects. This was a practical way to apply CSS animations in a fun and engaging way.
